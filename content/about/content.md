## Mathieu Grasset - QA / Testing

Many agencies produce work that 'kind of' works. We aim to produce work that you can rely on for your business. Our background is in sites that are Business Critical. Mathieu has the eye for detail to make sure things can go out working first time.

We have a number of other non-permanent team members who we work with as required. With a wide range of contacts within IT we can quickly build a larger team as required to handle larger projects or concurrent projects.
